The `exercises` directory contains the code snippets with intentional errors. Each exercise is in its own file, organized into subdirectories by topic (e.g. functions, variables).

The `tests` directory contains the test files for each exercise. Each test file should have the same name as the corresponding exercise file, with `_test` appended to the end (e.g. `variables1.py` -> `variables1_test.py`). The test files should be organized into subdirectories that mirror the structure of the `exercises` directory.

The `pylings.sh` script is used to run the tests for all exercises. The `pylings.py` script can be used to run the tests for a single exercise.
